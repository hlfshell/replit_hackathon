### Prompt for Front-End Developer:

Create a modern, responsive upload form that enables users to receive personality-based feedback on advertisements.

#### Design Specifications:

- **Layout:**

  - Centered card layout with rounded corners and a subtle drop-shadow.
  - White card positioned over a gentle purple gradient background to maintain a clean and contemporary aesthetic.

- **Content Elements:**

  - Headline: **"Please upload your AD here"**
  - Subheading: Clearly state the value proposition. Example: "Upload your ad to receive tailored feedback from selected consumer personalities."

- **Form Inputs:**

  - **Text box:** Allow users to add descriptive context or information about their advertisement. Clearly label this input (e.g., "Ad Description").
  - **Image Uploader:** Include drag-and-drop functionality and manual file selection. Specify supported file types (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF).
  - **Multi-select Dropdown:** Enable selection of up to 10 personalities. Each dropdown item should clearly show the personality's name and summary underneath for quick reference.
    - Include search and filtering functionality based on attributes such as age, occupation, location, etc.
    - Populate this dropdown dynamically by calling the API endpoint: `localhost/personalities`.
    - Assume the API returns data in the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "id": string,
  "name": string,
  "age": integer,
  "gender": string,
  "location": string,
  "education_level": string,
  "marital_status": string,
  "occupation": string,
  "job_title": string,
  "industry": string,
  "income": string,
  "seniority_level": string,
  "personality_traits": [string],
  "values": [string],
  "attitudes": [string],
  "interests": [string],
  "lifestyle": [string],
  "habits": [string],
  "frustrations": [string],
  "summary": string
}
```

- Clearly indicate how to handle and display a large number of personalities (pagination or scrolling).

- **Action Button:**

  - Include a clearly visible and inviting "Get Feedback" button to submit the form.

- **Footer and Additional Links:**

  - Provide unobtrusive links for Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Help/Support documentation below the form.
  - Include trust indicators, such as: "We respect your privacy."
